_PINK PALACE_  
I think sometimes about the person who moved here in 1974, when the room was new, in their new wig and hat, with a pair of gloves to match the floor when the carpet was a different shade of pink. Before the counters were swollen or the tiles chipped. There weren’t charms tucked in the fixtures back then, or friction lines of cats on the walls.

I wonder if they’re still living. I haven't been able to leave here for trying, maybe that happens to some of us—like her, I’ll step just right one day and dissolve into the carpet. We’ll all meet in plush space, our heads thrumming as static passes unimpeded through. Our eyes cloudy in a vapour of spilt wine and cat hair.

It’s so soft though—every direction is something to sink into, a long, enveloping embrace in days over decades. It stays warm either way, the sheets are drawn over now to the warp and weft edges of the place. When we clink our heads together we remember how sharp it can be out there. Our laughter just sounds like fuzzy breathing. Our crying just sounds like fuzzy breathing. I'm moving out some time, but I know I'm just not ready yet.
